Using a camera or cameras and computer vision to automatically align projector or monitor arrays is an attractive method to avoid the complex and tedious task of attempting to set up a composite display [8]. Raskar et al [7]
use cameras to achieve composite displays using structured
light methods.

 In case of the circle pattern, we
use the circle center as a control point and localize it in the
input images by using the center of the ellipse fitted to the
circle edge [6], we call this approach “Circle (ellipse fit)”.
The detected center of the ellipse is not the projected center
of the circle because of perspective distortion introduced by
the non-frontal orientation of the calibration grid [8]

...[8] is http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/papers/heikkila97.pdf:

Generally, we
can state that the ellipse center and projected circle center
are not the same for circular features with non-zero radius.
Ellipse fitting or the center of gravity method produces
estimates of the ellipse center. However, what we usually
want to know is the projection of the circle center. As a
consequence of the previous discussion, we notice that the
location is biased and it should be corrected using Eqs (15)
and (16). Especially, in camera calibration this is very
important, because the circular dot patterns are usually
viewed in skew angles

!!!!!!! -> new idea: apply rectifying homography to projector calibration image, detect circle centers, unrectify (!!)

https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.8499&rep=rep1&type=pdf:

Lines in the object space are mapped as lines on the image plane, but in general perspective projection is not a shape preserving transformation. Two- and three-dimensional shapes are deformed if they are not coplanar with the image plane. This is also true for circular landmarks,
which are commonly used control points in calibration. However, a bias between the observations and the model is induced if the centers of their projections in the image are treated as projections of the circle centers.
